Question: Python Programming The Scenario: You Are A Member Of The IT Team For The Game Show ‘Are You Smarter Than Mr. Sciallo?’ 
The Game Show Has Been Relying On An Older Quiz Game Buzzer System That Allows A Contestant To Buzz In And Then Locks The Panel So No Other 
Contestants Can Buzz In Until The Host Unlocks The Panel In Preparation For The Next Question. This problem has been solved! 
See the answer Python programming  The Scenario:  You are a member of the IT team for the game show ‘Are You Smarter Than Mr. Sciallo?’ 
The game show has been relying on an older quiz game buzzer system that allows a contestant to buzz in and then locks the panel so no other 
contestants can buzz in until the host unlocks the panel in preparation for the next question. However, the older system is not informative. 
It relied on humans seeing who buzzed in first. Nobody knew who buzzed in first and locked the panel, and it led to some heated discussions 
during video taping that had to be edited out. Your new system will remedy this by adding informative messages that will be printed on the monitor.  
Behaviors of your Application  When the application starts, it will announce itself and provide instructions on its use The instructions will 
also include the following Button and LED assignments Contestant 1 is assigned Button_1 and the rled Contestant 2 is assigned Button_2 and the 
yled Contestant 3 is assigned Button_3 and the gled The Game Show Host is assigned Button_4 to unlock the panel and turn off any light 
When the successful (fastest) contestant buzzes in, in addition to lighting the appropriate LED, a message indicating the buzz in will be sent to the console, 
and the console will be locked If another player attempts to buzz in while the console is locked, a message will be issued to the console notifying 
them that another contestant is already buzzed in When the host unlocks the console in preparation for the next question, a message will be issued to 
the console and any LEDS that are light will be turned off This program will run continuously Add logic into your program to tell a contestant who attempts 
to buzz in when the console is already locked if they are the ones who are already buzzed in and if not them, which of their fellow contestants is already 
buzzed in If the game show host erroneously attempts to unlock the console when it wasn’t locked to begin with, issue a message to the console indicating 
that the move was erroneous, for example, “The console is not currently locked” Since all of your buttons are in use, add a feature to exit the program if the 
light sensor is turned to simulate light (default is dark)
